# Add or Update Affiliations

Your project affiliations show your technical code contributions to a project by identifying your work history while you were actively contributing code or documentation. Populating your affiliations is a great way to tell your open source contribution story to your current and future employers, and your project communities. It also ensures that your organization gets credit for open source project work that you do on their behalf, or that you can highlight your individual contributions to a project. The following information is displayed:

* The name(s) of the project(s) that you have contributed to or are actively contributing to.
* The time period during which you were an active contributor.
* If you were contributing on behalf of an organization or as an individual contributor.

You should connect your GitHub and LinkedIn profiles to populate your affiliations, and ensure that your historical and future contributions all get correctly attributed to you.

### **What can you do?**

You can manage all of your project affiliations through the Individual Dashboard.
